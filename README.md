# Introduction-to-Python-Warehouse-Inventory-Expiry-Checker
This Python program simulates a warehouse shelf scan by taking row and column inputs through type casting and checking expiry status for each shelf. It uses nested loops to navigate rows and columns and conditional control structures to count expired and non-expired items, producing a clear summary per row.
